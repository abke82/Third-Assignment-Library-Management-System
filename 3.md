## Introduction:
- This assignment is working with a library. We have users and librarians and books in this library. 
- User can borrow and return book to library, see list of its books and logout.
- Librarian can add/remove/update librarian. add/remove/update user. add/remove/update book. Print all of users/librarians/books and can logout.
- The approach taken to complete the assignment is we have 5 classes(Main, Library, Librarian, User and book). Main is the first and main part. Library contain all of data and other classes contain specific data about their names.

## Design and Implementation:
- In main class, at frist create an onject from library class. constructor of library put username "admin" and password "admin" in hashmap of librarian in library ,then run menu. code has 3 choices (1.user access 2.librarian access 3.exit). In access, code get username, if it exists(At first the only way to access is admin), code run user menu or librarian menu on library class.
- In fact, library is data base, because it has hashmap of books, users and librarians objects. I used hashmap for linking objects to their names. If code has username/ISBN, it can use their related objects.
- In menu, code gives 3 chances to enter password. Code get password and compares input password with password of object with a function within class of that object.
- User menu has 4 items. For borrow, code use a function in user class, that put Requested book object in the books of user. For return book, code use a function in user class, it checks if user has that book, remove that book from books of user. For logout, break all of loop and come back to menu in main class.
- Librarian menu has 11 items. For add user/librarian/boook code has function in library class, they collect Information that is needed, then check if their names don't exist, add it in their hashmap with their key. For delete user/librarian/book code checks if their name exist, remove they from their hashmap. Update user/librarian/book collect new information and replace them. For logout, break all of loop and come back to menu in main class.
- Constructor are useful for initial setup.
  
## Testing and Evaluation:
- I was confused at first because code had very function. Then I wrote functions and classes on the paper and arranged them. It was very useful for understaning code.
- I changed location of functions several times between classes, then with designed UML I arranged them.
- Java scanner has a problem. When I get int(nextInt) and then want to get string(nextLine), sometimes it can't get string, it needs "in.nextline".

## Conclusion:
- We can develop code with swing for geraphical output.
- We can add another property for librarian and users.
